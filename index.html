    <!-- Congrats on passing the first puzzle. 
    Here is the next one, dear player(s)!

    The great forgers of Japan,
    Hate his mighty hand,
    The curves of Damascus,
    Flow with his mighty stands.
    The moisturizer's glory was discovered,
    His face gleamed with water.

    For his tale, a world-renowned,
    A tale that can traumatize lawyers around,
    A tale that is history of this world,
    Logged by one's love, you shall find your turn!

    good luck! -->
